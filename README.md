# CS360-Inventory-App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a recently hired team member of Mobile2App Company we have been hired to assist in helping develop a mobile application to tack items in a warehouse, Option 1: 
Inventory App. The Goal of the Inventory application is to track items in an inventory list through the primary use of mobile devices. This app will track the items 
through the app and assist in managing and trying to automate the logistics of the warehouse. The app will also allow the user to manage their inventory in real time. 
Users will be able to use this app on any Android device. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your 
designs successful?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To achieve these goal, it has been requested that the mobile application must have the minimum features :

-A database with at least two tables to store: Inventory items, User logins and passwords
-A screen for sign-in or sign-up into the app.
-A grid screen that displays all items in the inventory.
-A mechanism where the user can add and remove items from the inventory.
-A mechanism where the user can increase or decrease the number of specific items in the inventory.
-A mechanism to notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to zero

The UI designs that I had for my app keeps users in mind to make it easy and simple to use. This allowed the app to be user friendly when it came to registering, 
logging in, adding an item, and updating or deleting that item. I would say that the designs that I had for the app were sucessful because it captured every feature 
that was asked for Invetory app.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I approached creating my app by starting with the UI. This was the base of how I would set up the functions that would need to be in place. Then I would move through 
the app with coding and connecting the proper next screen to what I was working on. This way that I could see the flow of how the app would work but also keep me on 
track of where I am in the process. I would have to start with coding the database for the users which is why I started with the login screen and registration and then 
moved on to the other features that were iun the app. I think that the stratgie to start with the beginning will be helpful in the future. As this will be a way to keep 
me on track and allow me to tackle and connect sections that need to be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would ensure that the code was functional by running the code in the emulator. This was the challenge as this is something that is hard to do with an AMD CPU. I had 
to go into the BIOS to enable the setting that would allow me to use this function. At first it was very confusing as to why it wouldn't work and then I found out how 
to enable the right things to see the emulator. The emulator would allow me to have hands on with the app to make sure that everything was working as intended. While I 
think I should have used JUnit as this would allow me to make sure that the right coverage was there. I think that is something that I will need to remember in the 
future.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would say that my innovation would have come through with how I wanted the app to be laid out. While I want to do more with this app and add the ability to add 
multiple list it was something that I ran out of time for. However, in the time that I did have I did manage to overcome how to use Android Studio to be able to make 
the intial list that I have made.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
n what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think that the intial list screen is where it shows my knowledge, skills, and experience. This area is somewhere that I had to dig deep into learning and figure out 
the basic app desgin. I think it also shows my ability to overcome challeneges as well. As I struggled and over came that struggle. I think that the back end of my 
development could be better I do think that the UI portion was the mosr sucessful part of the app.
